Working version of a basic app that returns a variety of information about colleges and universities in the United States. In its current state colleges can be searched by a single city at a time.

In the future a more robust experience will be added including (but not limited to):
  [] multi city searching
  [] search the surrounding area (radius of n miles)
  [] filter search results by school size, cost, admission rate
  [] filter to ensure majority of data requested is reported
  [] filter by the Carnegie size and location metric 
      - groups institutions by the school size and the urbanization of the surrounding area
  [] sort results by size, cost, admission rate, alphabet
